Some projects that I googled would help me to learn Python by applying it.

- Asks the user to guess what number the computer is thinking of, between 1 and 20. 
- It gives hints on how to zone in on the correct guess.

- Takes user input in the form of a question and outputs one of the classic 8-ball phrases.

Random Password Generator:
- Asks the user for a password length and generates a random combination of numbers and letters.
- It asks for the purpose and stores the purpose and the password in a separate text file.
